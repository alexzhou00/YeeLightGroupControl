# YeeLightGroupControl
Some Python classes for controlling YeeLight using the Python yeelight library

## Resources 

QMK keymap for BDN9 Rev. 2 which I am using in conjunction with these files: https://github.com/alexzhou00/bdn9_alexzhou00.

## GOAL
I want to be able to use this library in order to control multiple groups of lights across the house. By listening to macros to trigger certain behaviors, I can ultimately use a macropad (BDN9 Rev. 2 with 3 rotary encoders) to control my lights.

## TODO
* Testing with multiple bulbs
* Testing with multiple groups
* Testing bulb naming utility
* Reconnecting to bulbs that restarted/disconnected
* Add more loading/saving config file functionality
* Lighting Presets
* Documentation
