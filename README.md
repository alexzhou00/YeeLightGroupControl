# YeeLightGroupControl
Some Python classes for controlling YeeLight using the Python yeelight library

## GOAL
I want to be able to use this library in order to control multiple groups of lights across the house. By listening to macros to trigger certain behaviors, I can ultimately use a macropad (BDN9 Rev. 2 with 3 rotary encoders) to control my lights.

## TODO
* Testing with multiple bulbs
* Saving / Loading configs
* Bulb naming utility
* Listening for key-presses / macros to activate some desired behavior
* Reconnecting to bulbs that restarted/disconnected
